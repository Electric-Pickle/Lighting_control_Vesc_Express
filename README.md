Lighting control Board For Vesc Based Pev's

THIS Branch Will be updated once there is a working tested design 

Features
* onboard 5v2a buck 160v in (turned on and off via CAN or SERIAL ports)
* 3 level shifted LED ws2812 or similar outputs, + 2 onboard 
* onboard USB-C (diode added for brains to be powered VIA usb)
* onboard CAN termination (solder jumper to activate)
* duck

Ordering,
* Gerbers are prepped for PCB fab and assembly service,
* board must be 0.6mm thick (has to be advanced anyways for the C3 mini) ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
* I've preordered the buck, but JLC doesnt stock it, easy enough to solder by hand(caution board is very dense)
